# SDEP_Project
**Developed a Memory Leak Logger tool to detect, log, and trace memory leaks in software applications.**

Implemented automated monitoring of memory allocation/deallocation, helping developers identify inefficient memory usage.

Designed detailed logging and reporting features, enabling faster debugging and performance optimization.

Integrated with C/C++ runtime environments for real-time leak detection, reducing debugging time and improving software reliability.
